"""Data structures describing a composed page.

A `ComposedPage` is the single source of truth for both the rendered image and
the ground-truth text file: the renderer draws it, and the ground-truth writer
serialises it. They cannot drift apart, which is what guarantees the ground
truth matches what is on the page.
