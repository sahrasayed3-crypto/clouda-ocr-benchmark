"""Image quality metrics used by the readability guard and the QC report.

The point of these is narrow: catch samples that are degraded past the point a
human could read them, so the benchmark measures OCR difficulty rather than
impossibility. Each metric is expressed as a *ratio against the clean page*, so
thresholds are independent of font, layout and page density.
